Welcome to the GNS3 AD pentesting lab practical guide. This guide will walk you through deploying an AD pentesting lab within GNS3, and walk you through different attacks that can be perpetrated in the vulnerable AD environment. 

This guide has walkthroughs to 2 different AD labs: a single-domain lab and a multi-domain lab. The multi-domain lab has a bigger variety of attack scenarios, but is heavier on resources when compared with the single-domain lab.

Choose your preferred scenario and start with setting up the lab by navigating to the respective scenario's page through the "Multi-domain AD Lab"/"Single-domain AD Lab" buttons seen in the upper left corner.

This webpage also contains an Active Directory Security report, with comprehensive AD background and detailed attack explanations. Refer to it at any time to learn more about the attacks present in the practical guides. To access it, press the "Active Directory Extended Report" button.

Have fun!
